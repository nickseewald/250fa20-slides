# Homework 2 Comments `r emo::ji("pencil")`

- A causal *statement* is any sentence that is about causation.
  - "There is not evidence to say that eating chia seeds causes weight loss" **is** a causal statement
  - "Chia seeds do not cause weight loss" **is** a causal statement
  - Causal *statements* do not require causal *relationships*

- Generalizability to a population is a result of sampling: how are data collected?
  - Sample size isn't really a big deal
  - Good (random) sampling = generalizable; bad sampling = not generalizable

---
# Homework 2 Comments `r emo::ji("pencil")`

- Review your homework! Even questions you got full credit on.
- You should have comments on every question you lost points on.
- Remember we don't grade every question for correctness.

# Weekly Advice
We're focusing a lot on random sampling this week.

###Your mileage may vary!
Your results *will* be different from mine and from your collaborators'.

# Integer Sequences in R
- A **vector** is a way to hold a collection of things in R. Think of it as a pill organizer.
- This week, we're going to create a vector that holds a sequence of consecutive integers.

```{r integerSeq}
1:6
```

- Read the colon `:` as "through", so `1:6` is "1 through 6"

---
# Sampling in R

- Think of `1:6` as representing a six-sided die.
- We can "roll" the die by taking a `sample()` from the vector `1:6`

```{r sample}
sample(1:6, size = 1)
```

- Run the `sampleDieRoll` chunk (line ~63) and type what you got in the chat!

---
# Sampling With vs. Without Replacement

- Consider randomly selecting 6 values from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. 
  - Say our first pick is 3.
  - What do we do with 3? Do we take 3 out of the set (don't *replace* it), or do we put it back in (*replace* it)?
  
--

```{r withoutReplace}
sample(1:6, size = 6, replace = F)
```

--

```{r withReplace}
sample(1:6, size = 6, replace = T)
```

--

- Which of these strategies represents die-rolling in real life?

---
# Law of Large Numbers

As you collect more data, sample averages will get close to population averages ("*expected values*").

.pull-left[
Roll dice
```{r dieRollsEx1, results = 'hold', echo = F}
(die1 <- sample(1:6, size = 1, replace = T))
(die2 <- sample(1:6, size = 2, replace = T))
(die3 <- sample(1:6, size = 3, replace = T))
(die4 <- sample(1:6, size = 4, replace = T))
(die5 <- sample(1:6, size = 5, replace = T))
```
]
.pull-right[
Average of rolls
```{r dieRollsEx1Mean, results = 'hold', echo = F}
mean(die1)
mean(die2)
mean(die3)
mean(die4)
mean(die5)
```
]
--
The mean seems like it's trying to do something, but it's too variable to really see what's happening.

# Law of Large Numbers

```{r lln, echo = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 14}
sixSidedDieRoll <- function(n) {
  mean(sample(1:6, size = n, replace = T))
}
par(mar = c(5, 6, 4, 2) + .01)
plot(sapply(1:300, sixSidedDieRoll), 
     xlab = "Number of Six-Sided Dice",
     ylab = "Average", pch = 20,
     cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 2, cex = 2)
abline(h = 3.5)
```

---
# Expected Value

We can compute the value that the sample averages will converge to!

$$ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot p_i $$

- $\Sigma$ means "summation" (addition)
- $x_i$ is the value (in our case, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)
- $p_i$ is the *probability* of observing the value 

For the six-sided die, the expected value is
--
$$ 1 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + 3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + 5 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + 6 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = 3.5$$

# Scatterplots
A **scatterplot** is a way to display the relationship between quantitative explanatory (x) and response (y) variables.

The data are paired (x, y) and then each pair is plotted on a grid.

We can use scatterplots to look for **associations** between these quantitative variables.

---
# Scatterplots (line ~142)
.pull-left[
```{r scatterplotCode, fig.keep = 'none'}
plot(penguins$bill_length_mm,
     penguins$body_mass_g,
     main = "Scatterplot of Bill Length versus Body Mass of Penguins",
     xlab = "Bill Length in mm",
     ylab = "Body Mass in g")
```

- positive association
- reasonably linear
- moderately strong
- no apparent unusual points
]
.pull-right[
```{r scatterplot, echo = F, fig.height = 6}
par(mar = c(4, 5, 4, 2) + .1)
plot(penguins$bill_length_mm, penguins$body_mass_g,
     main = "Scatterplot of Bill Length versus Body Mass of Penguins",
     xlab = "Bill Length in mm",
     ylab = "Body Mass in g", 
     cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.5, cex = 1.5, cex.main = 1.3)
```
]

# Correlation
- The **correlation** between two quantitative variables quantifies the strength of the *linear* association.
- Denote correlation by $r$
- As $\lvert r \rvert$ gets close to 1, the linear relationship becomes stronger

```{r corExample, echo = F, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 14, fig.align = 'center'}
library(MASS)
par(mfrow = c(1, 4), mar = c(1,1,1,1))
plot(mvrnorm(100, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, -1, -1, 1), nrow = 2), empirical = T), xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n', ylab = "", xlab = "")
legend("topright", legend = "r = -1", cex = 2)
plot(mvrnorm(100, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, -.6, -.6, 1), nrow = 2), empirical = T), xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n', ylab = "", xlab = "")
legend("topright", legend = "r = -.6", cex = 2)
plot(mvrnorm(100, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, .3, .3, 1), nrow = 2), empirical = T), xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n', ylab = "", xlab = "")
legend("topleft", legend = "r = 0.3", cex = 2)
plot(mvrnorm(100, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 1), nrow = 2), empirical = T), xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n', ylab = "", xlab = "")
legend("topleft", legend = "r = 1", cex = 2)
