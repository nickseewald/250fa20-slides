# This Week's Learning Objectives

.pull-left[
### Statistical Learning Objectives
1. Understand the structure of data (observations and variables)
2. Think about the scope of a data set: what questions can and cannot be answered with a particular data set?
]
.pull-right[
### R Learning Objectives
1. Learn how to "assign" information to "objects" in R
2. See how R "reads in" a data set from a file
3. Be able to identify the names of variables contained in a data set
4. Make a frequency table for one or two variables

# R Markdown Tips `r emo::ji("technologist")`

- Please don't modify the pre-written chunks of code!

- When copying and pasting code, only take the code

- Don't delete any blank lines

- Always have a blank line after a chunk

# Let's get started!

# Assignment

R can do a lot of stuff, and we usually want to "save" results to use later.

The way we tell R to remember something is to *assign* that thing a name.

```{r assignment1}
x <- 36 / 6
```

The arrow is R's *assignment operator*: "`x` *gets* 6". R now remembers that `x` is equal to 6.
```{r use-x}
x
```

---
class: inverse

# Important note: R is "case-sensitive"

R treats lower-case and upper-case letters as *different things*. Check it out:

```{r x}
# lower-case x; this is 6
x
```

```{r X, error = T}
# upper-case X; this doesn't exist
X
```

# Palmer Penguins Data `r emo::ji("penguin")`
We're going to learn about some basic R functions using a data set on 333 penguins living on 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. 

.pull-left[
Data were made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research area](pal.lternet.edu), a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were prepared by [Dr. Allison Horst](github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins)

# Reading in a CSV file

Remember this code?

```{r readData}
penguins <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS250SBI/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_NArm.csv"))
```

Notice the assignment operator? "`penguins` *gets* `read.csv` *of* [blah blah blah]"

--

`read.csv` *reads* in a .csv file (**c**omma **s**eparated **v**alues) and creates a `data.frame`

```{r whatsaCSV, echo = F}
write.csv(head(penguins), row.names = F)
```

---

# Recall: Use `head()` to peek at the data

```{r headPenguins}
head(penguins)
```

---
# Names in a dataset

When working with data in R, it's important to know *exactly what things are called*. 

What if we just wanted to know the names of the variables that are contained in `penguins`?

```{r names}
names(penguins)
```

---
# Naming things in R
When giving things names in R, you can only use a combination of letters, numbers, periods, and underscores, and the names have to start with a letter or a period. People tend to use underscores or periods instead of spaces.

.pull-left[
```{r badName1, error = T}
tik tok <- 12
```

```{r badName2, error = T}
4eva <- 4 * 2 
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r badName3, error = T}
_hi_mom <- 5^2
```

```{r goodNames}
tiktok <- 12
forever <- 4 * 2
dear_mother <- 5^2
```
]

---
# Exploring Data

To see a data frame's *structure*, use the function `str()` (pronounced "stir"):
```{r str}
str(penguins)
```

---
# Exploring Data

If you really only want the "dimension" of the data frame (i.e., how many rows and how many columns), you can use the `dim()` function:
```{r dim}
dim(penguins)
```

The results are given in the order "rows, columns" because data is **R**eally **C**ool (rows, columns).

---

# Recall: Bar Charts in R `r emo::ji("bar_chart")`

In order to make this plot, we had to give `barplot()` a "frequency table" of the variable `species`.

```{r plotOptions, echo = F, include = T}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
```

```{r speciesPlot, fig.align='center', fig.height=3, dev = 'svg', results='hide'}
barplot(table(penguins$species), #<<
     xlab = "Species",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Bar Chart of Number of Penguins of Each Species Observed",
     col = c("darkorange1", "mediumorchid2", "darkcyan"))
```

---

# Frequency Tables

A *frequency table* is a way to count the number of observations (rows) in the data that correspond to each level of a categorical variable.

To make a frequency table, use the `table()` function
```{r table}
table(penguins$species)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("money_mouth_face")` `r emo::ji("money_mouth_face")` `r emo::ji("money_mouth_face")`

The dollar sign (`$`) is how we tell R where to look for a particular variable.

```{r table2, results = "hide"}
table(penguins$species)
```

Inside `table()`, we need to tell R to look for the variable `species` inside the data.frame called `penguins`. If we don't include `penguins$`, watch what happens:

```{r noDollarSign, error = T}
table(species)
```

---
# Two-Way Frequency Tables

We can make "two-way" frequency tables (sometimes called "contingency tables") to summarize counts for two categorical variables:
```{r twoWayTable}
table(penguins$species, penguins$island)
```

Remember that data is **r**eally **c**ool, so the first variable you give to `table()` is in the **r**ows of the table, and the second is in the **c**olumns.

Notice that we separated the two variables inside of `table()` with a comma.
