# What happened with this (historic) strike?
- I am in a labor union, the Graduate Employees' Organization (GEO).
  - One of the oldest grad employee unions in the US!
- A strike is a union's "nuclear option" and is only used when all else fails. It is not (and was not) a decision taken lightly by GEO membership.
--

- Longest GEO strike since 1975
- Massive cross-campus and national support
- Forced U-M to talk about issues they've ignored for years
--

- Ended not because deal was good; U-M severely threatened "union security"
- The real work starts *now*

---
# My commitment to you

- Administrators say strike was to your detriment; I disagree
   - Goal was to ensure safe campus for *all* community members
- The fight continues!
  - RA's still on strike
  - MDining and other staff groups still fighting for better conditions
  - DPSS still has a higher budget than the Rackham Graduate School

**I am here to support you. Let me know how.**

# Notes on common fears

### Math
- **This is not a math class.** The focus is not on doing algebra or manipulating formulas. There are numbers, but we're more interested in *conceptual understanding* of statistical ideas.
- **It's okay if you haven't taken stats before.** 63% of students in class didn't take stats in high school.

### Coding
- **This is not a coding class.** You'll learn some things about coding, but the focus is **not** on learning to code. Once you get the basics of R, we'll turn more towards statistics.
- Learning to code is about **trial and error**. Stick with it!
- I've been using R for a decade and I Google stuff *constantly*.

### Staying on Track
- **Spend at least 20-30 minutes on statistics every day.** Reviewing material in small chunks will help reinforce the concepts (and make exam prep easier!)
- **Use resources.** eCoach has to-do lists for each week, and the Canvas homepage has one too!

### "I'm bad at stats/math/etc."
- **FALSE.** Success in this course reflects *effort* not baseline ability.
- You *will* make mistakes, but *that's how humans learn*.
- "Negative self-talk will limit you." (Christina Knudson, Ph.D.)
- YOU `r emo::ji("clap")` CAN `r emo::ji("clap")` DO `r emo::ji("clap")` IT

### Remote learning
- **Reasonable!** These are challenging times. Try to make the best of it, but we're all going to struggle with it.
- **Your humanity comes first**
- Remember that **I am here to help**
]
--
.pull-right[
### Picky wording
- **Generally a thing of the past.** 
- Focus on conveying your ideas as precisely as you can

### "I'm going to fail the class"
- Reframe "I have to get X grade" to "I *want* to get X grade"
- "Negative self-talk will limit you."
