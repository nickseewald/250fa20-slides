# Lab 3 Comments

(Sorry I'm still a bit behind on grading)

- Please be careful to answer all parts of every question!
- When deciding number of breaks for a histogram, try to avoid empty bins.
- Skew direction is which side the tail is on
  - Skew right implies mean > median; skew left implies mean < median 
- In Dive Deeper 2, I think we should keep the outlier: there's no reason to believe that William and Mary is fundamentally different from other public schools.
  - **"Accuracy" or numerical convenience is not a good reason to eliminate a data point.**

---
# Homework 3 Summary

- **SHOW WORK.** No work = no points `r emo::ji('sad')`

- **Independent events:** $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B)$ *if and only if A, B are independent*.
Same thing with $P(A\mid B) = P(A)$. 
  - This must hold *exactly*: 0.786 $\neq$ 0.75

- Events can be mutually exclusive, independent, or neither, but *not both*. 
  - Use numerical support; don't rely on logic.

# Weekly Advice
- R "draws" graphs like ink on paper. Make a graph (e.g., `plot()`), then use other functions to draw on top of the graph. 
  - Because R draws in "ink", there's no eraser! You need to start over by running `plot()` again.
- **The way to get a graphic you like is by trying stuff and adjusting.**
- Use R's built-in help for "graphical parameters"! In the console, type `?par`.

# Vectors in R (line 59)
- A **vector** is a way to hold a collection of things in R. Think of it as a pill organizer.
- We can make vectors using the `c()` function. `c` here stands for **c**ombine. 

```{r vectorExample}
x <- c(1, 72.15, -4)
x
```

---
# `stringsAsFactors` (line 70)
```{r penguins}
penguins <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS250SBI/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_NArm.csv",
                     stringsAsFactors = T) #<<
```

- We've got an extra argument to `read.csv()` called `stringsAsFactors`.
- Tells `read.csv()` that it should treat data that looks like text as a categorical variable.
- In STATS 250, text-like data will almost always be a categorical variable, so we'll be setting `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` often.

# Scatterplots Revisited (line 82)

```{r massDepthPlot, fig.show="hide"}
plot(bill_depth_mm ~ body_mass_g, 
     data = penguins,
     main = "Scatterplot of Penguin Body Mass vs. Bill Depth",
     xlab = "Bill Depth (mm)",
     ylab = "Body Mass (g)")
```

Notice:

1. "Formula syntax": We specified `y ~ x` in the `plot()` code.
1. Pretty obvious clustering here! **What could be the reason for this?**

# Scatterplots: Color-Coding Points (line 97)

     xlab = "Bill Depth (mm)",
     ylab = "Body Mass (g)",
     col = c("midnightblue", "brown1", "mediumseagreen")[penguins$species]) #<<
```

- Set `col` argument to a vector of colors
- Use `[]` to select color based on categorical variable
- Use color **with restraint**

# Color Should Have Meaning

This looks fun, but what does the color *mean*?

Color should convey information, and enhance readability.

# Correlation (line 165)

Last week's scatterplot:
```{r lengthMassPlot, fig.show="hide"}
plot(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm,
     data = penguins,
     main = "Scatterplot of Penguin Body Mass versus Bill Length",
     xlab = "Bill Length (mm)",
     ylab = "Body Mass in (g)")
```

```{r lengthMassCor}
cor(penguins$bill_length_mm, penguins$body_mass_g)
```
]

.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("lengthMassPlot", "png")`)

# Correlation Matrices (line 183)

First, subset the data to just look at quantitative variables, then feed that subset to `cor()` to compute a *correlation matrix*

```{r correlationMatrix}
numericPenguins <- subset(penguins, select = c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g"))
cor(numericPenguins)
```

Each "entry" in the correlation matrix is the correlation between the variables labeling that entry's row and column.

---
# Linear Regression (line 197)

<!-- To run linear regression use `lm()` and formula syntax (`y ~ x`) -->

```{r lm1}
reg1 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins)
summary(reg1)
```

---
# ANOVA Tables (line 214)
Give your regression model (ours is `reg1`) to the `anova()` function:

```{r anova}
anova(reg1)
```

$$R^2 = \frac{\text{SSM}}{\text{SST}}$$

### Your tasks
1. Introduce yourself to your collaborators!
1. **Work together** to complete the "Try It!" and "Dive Deeper" portions of the lab assignment by copy/pasting and modifying appropriate code from earlier in the document.

### How to get help
- I'll be floating around between breakout rooms to check on everyone
- Use the "Ask for help" button to flag me down
- Let me know when you're done
