# Course Policy

## Flexibility
.pull-left[
- This is going to be an unusual semester. 
- Things like the office hours schedule and the schedule of topics **may change**.
- Please try to be flexible with us as we adapt to this new learning environment, as we'll be flexible with you.

# Lab Rules and Responsibilities

.pull-left[
## 1. Be Respectful.
- Respect to me includes being here on time and staying until dismissed
  - Notify me of conflicts in advance
- Treat your classmates with dignity and *learn from your differences*
- Respect yourself: *come here to learn*
]

.pull-right[
## 2. Actively Collaborate.
- Lab activities will involve working with your peers: you should participate and learn from each other.
- The time will pass faster if you're having conversations and working together!

# Health and Well-Being

College is hard (**especially now**). Your health and well-being are more important than this class.

If you're struggling with mental health, there are resources available to you at [wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu](https://wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu). 

CAPS: [caps.umich.edu](https://caps.umich.edu) or 734.764.8312

*If you become ill, please report the illness to LSA: https://webapps.lsa.umich.edu/SAA/UGStuAdv/App/Illness/RptIll.aspx*

**Let me know what's going on and I'll do my best to help.**

---

# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

It's important to me to cultivate a learning environment in which everyone's identities (race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.) are respected. To this end:
- If you feel that your performance in the class is being affected by experiences inside **or** outside the classroom, please let me know.
- DEI is a process: I (and many others) am still learning about different perspectives and identities. If anything is said in class (by anyone, including by me) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me know.

# Is this a math class?

Statistics is a *mathematical science*. This course will involve elements of a typical math course, but also less typical aspects.

- Often, you will be required to apply statistical knowledge *and* everyday knowledge ("common sense") to solve problems.
- In statistics, there is not always a "correct" answer. You should be prepared to argue (in words) for why your answer is reasonable.
- Written components of assignments are critical.

**TL;DR**
This is NOT a math class. So if you're "not a math person", don't worry.

# Let's get started!

# Learning Objectives

.pull-left[
### Statistical Learning Objectives
1. Visualize categorical data
2. Summarize quantitative and categorical data
]
.pull-right[
### R Learning Objectives
1. Learn the difference between R, R Studio, and R Markdown
2. Become familiar with the R Studio interface 
3. Understand key components of an R Markdown document
4. Become familiar with R functions and arguments
]

# Getting Started: What is R?

- Statisticians (that means you!) often use computers to analyze data. 
- **R** is a popular (and powerful) program for manipulating data, doing calculations, and making graphs.
- R works by writing **`R code`**.

### Wait omg is this a coding class???

.pull-left[
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/isaac-no.gif" style="width:70%;"></div>
]

Over the course of the semester, you'll learn how to edit and write some basic R code to help you analyze data to answer research questions. **This will always be through the lens of answering statistical questions.**

# Using R as a Calculator

At its most basic, R is a fancy calculator.

Here's a code chunk in which we do some math:
````markdown
`r ''````{r calculatorExample}
5 * 7
```
````

Output:

```{r calculatorExample}
5 * 7
```

---

# Try it!

In your R Markdown document, edit the code chunk that looks like this (line ~79) to compute 50 divided by 9:
````md
`r ''````{r tryItCalculator, error = T}
# Write code here! This text is a comment, so it's not run by R. Replace it with
# code to compute 50 divided by 9.
```
````

--
Solution:

```{r tryItCalculator}
50 / 9
```

# Palmer Penguins Data `r emo::ji("penguin")`
We're going to learn about some basic R functions using a data set on 333 penguins living on 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. 

.pull-left[
Data were made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research area](pal.lternet.edu), a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were prepared by [Dr. Allison Horst](github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins)
]

.pull-right[![Illustration of penguin species. Artwork by @allison_horst.](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)
]

---

# First Steps

### "Read in" data

```{r readData}
penguins <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS250SBI/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_NArm.csv"))
```

- You'll learn more about this next week
- For now, the important thing to know is that we've told R we want to use a data set at that URL and we want to call it `penguins`.
---

# First Steps 

### Peek at the first 6 rows of the data
```{r headPenguins}
head(penguins)
```

---

# Bar Charts in R `r emo::ji("bar_chart")`

Let's make a bar chart of the number of penguins observed in each species:

```{r plotOptions, echo = F, include = T}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
```

```{r speciesPlot, fig.align='center', fig.height=3, dev = 'svg'}
barplot(table(penguins$species), #<<
     xlab = "Species",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Bar Chart of Number of Penguins of Each Species Observed",
     col = c("darkorange1", "mediumorchid2", "darkcyan"))
```

---

# Numerical Summaries

We can use R to summarize data numerically. A good way to do this is the `summary()` function.

```{r flipperSummaries}
summary(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```

# Group Discussion `r emo::ji("dancers")`

You will be **randomly** moved to a breakout room for the rest of the lab (minus ~10 minutes)

.pull-left[
### Your tasks
1. Introduce yourself to your collaborators!
1. **Work together** to complete the "Try It!" and "Discussion" portions of the lab assignment by copy/pasting and modifying appropriate code from earlier in the document.
]

.pull-right[
### How to get help
- I'll be floating around between breakout rooms to check on everyone
- Use the "Ask for help" button to flag me down
- Let me know when you're done
