### <a name="lab2"></a>Lab 2: Basics of Data with R
Lab materials for the week running Friday 9/4 - Friday 9/11. *All labs are asynchronous due to Labor Day.*

#### Statistical Learning Objectives
1. Understand the structure of data (observations and variables)
2. Think about the scope of a data set: what questions can and cannot be answered with a particular data set?

#### R Learning Objectives
1. Learn how to "assign" information to "objects" in R
2. See how R "reads in" a data set from a file
3. Be able to identify the names of variables contained in a data set
4. Make a frequency table for one or two variables

Lab materials for the week running Friday 9/18 - Friday 9/25.

#### Statistical Learning Objectives
1. Sampling with replacement versus sampling without replacement
1. The Law of Large Numbers and expected values
1. Scatterplots with linear associations
