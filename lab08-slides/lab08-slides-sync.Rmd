# Midterm Recap

<img src="../../midtermDist.png" width=80% />

--

If the midterm didn't go as expected *that's OKAY*. There's plenty of semester left.

---

# What's the plan?

Today we're going to learn about "sampling distributions" and something called the **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT).

--

The central limit theorem is sort of magical. We'll talk about it in more detail in lecture!

# Sampling Distributions

A **sampling distribution** refers to the possible values for a *statistic* (e.g., $\hat{p}$) and how often those values occur.

We've sort of seen sampling distributions already. Can you think of how?

--

The histograms we've made of $\hat{p}_{\mathrm{sim}}$ are sampling distributions of $\hat{p}$ (under the null hypothesis model)!

# Penguins!

```{r penguins}
penguins <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS250SBI/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_NArm.csv",
                     stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

# Penguins!

Let's remind ourselves of what variables are in this data:

```{r penguinsExplore, error = T}
# Use your favorite function or two to explore the data

```

--

```{r penguinsExplore2, error = T}
# Use your favorite function or two to explore the data
names(penguins)
```

--

> IMPORTANT NOTE: For the purposes of this example, we're going to assume that the penguins in the data represent the *population* of all penguins in the Palmer Archipelago. This is obviously not true: there are more than 333 penguins living on these islands. *This is just to illustrate ideas*.

---
# "Population" proportions

Assuming our data is on the full population of penguins in the archipelago, how could we find the population proportion of Gentoo penguins?

--

```{r speciesProportions}
proportions(table(penguins$species))
```

--

$$p = 0.357$$
where $p$ is the population proportion of Gentoo penguins in the Palmer Archipelago

---

# `set.seed()`

Start by setting the seed:

```{r setSeed}
set.seed(7923)
```

Things to remember when setting the seed:

- Guaranteed to get the same results from the same code in the *knitted* document
- Determines the *sequence* of random numbers: things can get knocked off sequence
- Use "Run All Chunks Above" to get back on sequence and to get the same numbers as in the knitted document

---
# Taking a sample
Take a sample of size 20 from the "population" of all penguins:

```{r penguinSample1}
sample1 <- penguins[sample(1:333, size = 20), ]
```

--

```{r penguinSampleHead, echo = F}
head(sample1, 2)
```

--

```{r sample1GentooProp}
proportions(table(sample1$species))
```

---
# Taking *another* sample

```{r penguinSample2}
sample2 <- penguins[sample(1:333, size = 20), ] # reusing the same code as above
proportions(table(sample2$species))
```

We get different results! This is expected, it's *sample-to-sample variability*.

As the size of our samples increases, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ becomes...


1. more obviously centered around $p$
1. narrower
1. more bell-shaped
]

---
# Central Limit Theorem

> If we look at a proportion (or difference in proportions) and the scenario satisfies certain conditions, then the sample proportion (or difference in proportions) will appear to follow a bell-shaped curve called the *normal distribution*.

--

##Conditions:

1. **Observations in the sample are independent.** Guaranteed by random sampling or random allocation to treatment/control.
1. **The sample is large enough.** "Large enough" means $n\times p \geq 10$ *and* $n\times (1-p) \geq 10$ ($p$ the *population* proportion).
